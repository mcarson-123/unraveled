unraveled
=========
### What?
This will (eventually) be a new layout of the ravelry site.
### Why?
Learn new things of course. And attempt a new layout of the ravelry info.
### How?
Express, Angular, npm, Heroku, Ravelry API
### When?
When the big hand hits the "s" and the little hand hits the "oon".

## Current state
I am currently at baby step 0.5. Just getting my feet wet with the technologies, and no API key yet. More to come very soon!

## Immediate next steps:
- Once ravelry API key is received, actually do user login.
	- keep track of user's session
- Clean up package structure
- Prettify a bit (or a lot); CSS, twitter-bootstrap, etc.
